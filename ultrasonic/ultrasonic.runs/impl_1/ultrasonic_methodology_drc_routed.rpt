2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell katot_reg[7]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) katot_reg[0]/PRE, katot_reg[1]/PRE, katot_reg[2]/PRE, katot_reg[3]/PRE, katot_reg[4]/PRE, katot_reg[5]/PRE, katot_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
